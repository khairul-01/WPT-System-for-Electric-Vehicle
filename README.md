# WPT-System-for-Electric-Vehicle
This Project is about Wireless Power Transfer for Electric Vehicle.

To address battery related limitation, the concept of 
Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has been proposed. WPT system 
transfer electric energy from power source to load without wired 
connection conveniently. The optimal specification of a resonant circuit 
is studied and discussed. The WPT system is verified by performing 
simulation test in the MATLAB/Simulink environment
